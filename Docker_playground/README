docker build -t nodeApp .
docker run  -p 8080:9090  nodeApp

IF
  index.js -> Running on 9999     | Here, 9999 is running the app in docker process   
  Dockerfile -> Exposing 9090     | but docker is exposing 9090(no app is running on 9090)
  docker run  -p 8080:9090        | & 8080 is binding to port 9090 which is not running the app

  that is why: 
              9999 -> app
              9090 -> undefined
              8080 -> undefined
